## Description

This website was created to practice our branching skills with if/else statements in JavaScript. Upon opening this webpage, a prompt will open asking the user to enter their age. If the user enters a number greater than or equal to 18, it will display information and links for registration and polls. If the user enters a number that's less than 18, the webpage will display a heading informing the user that they are too young to vote and include links for voting age requirements and resources. If the user does not enter a number, another prompt pop up box will display giving the user one more chance to enter a valid number. If the user enters a valid number the second time, the webpage will respond as described above. If the user doesn't enter a valid number the second time, an error message will display on this screen instructing the user to refresh the page and try again.
